Snake game is a popular video game which is played by many around the world. In the  game the red point(s) represent a snake and at a particular coordinate and the green dots represents a food item. The food items are provided at the several coordinates of the screen randomly every second for the snake to eat. Every time the snake eats the food item its length will be increased along with the score. The goal of the game is to eat as many food items as possible as a player. The snake grows larger by consuming more and more food items. In this player can control the movement of the snake by using the fist or palm of the hand using Computer Vision (AI). The snake moves as the player starts moving hand freely. When you have collected enough food items your progress goes onto the next level, where your snake gets longer and gets larger along with the score and if the snake hits itself or the wall the game ends.
